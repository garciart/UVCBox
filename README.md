## Introduction

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has quickly outpaced supply. Unfortunately, it appears that high demand for PPE, such as N95-rated respirators, will continue into the summer months, and there are no practical alternatives to these items. In addition, large health care systems quickly collect PPE supply as it appears, reducing the PPE available for smaller systems, such as local fire departments, health care clinics, etc.

For these local systems, we ask if we can extend our PPE through decontamination. Specifically, we ask: Can we extend the working life of N-95 respirators through decontamination with UVC light?

## What are N95 respirators?

A N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) is a tight-fitting respirator that provides the user with respiratory protection against hazardous dust, fumes, and mists. Its design must be evaluated, tested, and approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The respirator is to be used in workplaces free of oil aerosols, and, as stated in its name, the respirator must filter out 95% of particulates 0.3 microns in size or larger, including aerosols in concentration of 200 mg/m3 (Approval of Respiratory Protective Devices, 2004). It uses several layers of randomly interwoven fibers and an electrostatic charge to capture particles before they are inhaled by the user. The respirator provides more protection as it accumulates particles, albeit at the cost of breathing efficiency. The respirator, however, does not neutralize contaminants, whether chemical, biological, or radiological.

## What is Ultraviolet Light?

UV light is an electromagnetic radiation of photons, moving in wavelengths between 10 nanometers (nm) and 400 nm:

***Table: Types of Electromagnetic Radiation***

|Common Term	              |Wavelength                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
|Gamma Radiation            |Up to 0.001 nm            |
|X-Rays	                    |0.01 to 10 nm             |
|UV Light                   |10 - 400 nm               |
|Visible Light              |400 - 700 nm              |
|Infrared Light             |700 - 1,000,000 nm or 1 mm|
|Microwaves                 |1 mm to 1 m               |
|UHF, FM, and AM Radio Waves|1 m to 100 m              |

While ISO-21348 identifies nine (9) sub-types of UV light, the forms of UV light that can be easily replicated on Earth are UVA, UVB, and UVC. The Sun naturally emits these types of UV radiation; the Earth's ozone layer absorbs almost all UVC rays and most UVB rays. UVA light is not blocked and is visible at longer wavelengths (in the form of "black lights") when radiation of visible light is low or absent. The effect of UV light are as follows:

-	Acute exposure to UVA causes pigmentation (i.e., tanning) and chronic exposure causes wrinkles by breaking down collagen fibers in the dermis in humans.

-	Acute exposure to UVB causes tanning at a more rapid rate, but can also cause sunburn, and chronic exposure can cause skin cancer by damaging the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of skin cells of humans (Wurtmann & Wolin, 2009).

-	Acute exposure to UVC results in rapid onset of all the acute and chronic effects of UVA and UVB radiation, as well as damage to the RNA of other types of cells, in all organisms, including viruses (Wurtmann & Wolin, 2009).
